# Graph Database NJ

[TOC]

## Description

**Graph Database NJ** is an OSS-specific ADP micro service based on Neo4J.

It provides Neo4J Helm charts, Docker containers, and configuration files
required to deploy Neo4J to a Kubernetes cluster.

A graph database uses graph structure for semantic queries with nodes,
edges and properties to represent and store data. A key concept
of the system is the graph (or edge or relationship),
which directly relates data items in the store.
The relationships allow stored data to be linked together directly,
and in many cases retrieved with one operation.
